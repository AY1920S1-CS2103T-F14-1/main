== PROJECT: Duke Academy

=== About the Project
My team of 4 Computer Science students were tasked with enhancing a basic Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop addressbook
application for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph it into a coding practice application called Duke Academy.

Duke Academy is written in the Java programming language and the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the application is
created with JavaFX. It relies primarily on Command Line Interface (CLI) as its primary input for user commands.

Duke Academy is designed for both coding students and educators alike. It is equipped with a library of programming
questions related to the field of Data Structures and Algorithms for students to practice their coding skills and allows
educators to set their own problem statements for their students to attempt. This enhanced application also allows
students to run their programs within the app itself, track their programming practice history and make personalized notes
all in one application, without the need for external tools.

This is how our project looks like:

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a brief overview of my contributions to the project. A summary of my coding, documentation and other
relevant details will be listed below.

*Major enhancement added*: I have integrated a built-in text editor with a line counter component.

** *What it does:*
. The built-in text editor allows users to code out their solutions internally within Duke Academy itself.
. It is also fully capable of performing auto-indentations for the user.
. The text-editor also has a line counter component which helps the user to keep track and manage his code for
convenient reference.

** *Justification (Text Editor):* This feature improves the product significantly because users do not need to source for an external
text editor to code out their solutions for problems and can instead do everything within Duke Academy itself. This then
increases the productivity of users as they would not need to constantly switch between the external editor and Duke
Academy while attempting questions, providing a hassle-free coding experience.

** *Justification (Auto-Indentation):* This quality-of-life feature significantly increases the user coding experience
in Duke Academy because it helps users organize and compartmentalize their code automatically. Having auto-indentation
means that users do not need to key in 4 spaces manually after every code block, and thus it helps the user uphold
code readability without the user having to do anything on their part.

** *Justification (Line Counter):* This feature adds significant value to the product because it allows users to keep track
of the micro-details in their code. For example, should anything go wrong with their code (e.g. compilation error), they
can quickly trace down the source of the bug and make the necessary changes efficiently and conveniently without having
to trace through line-by-line.

** *Highlights:* This feature is designed to imitate, as closely as possible, the functions of an Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) editor. The implementation of this feature was exceptionally challenging as there were no exact tutorials
on how to design a text editor with the above mentioned features specifically, and thus it was only made possible by putting
together all the small parts.

*Minor enhancement*: Added a UI format for QuestionCard.

* *What it does:* Displays a summary of the question with a clean look that fits the theme of DukeAcademy. It is redesigned
to reflect the topics of the selected question, and the attributes such as whether it is attempted by the user and its
difficulty level.

* *Justification:* This provides the user with adequate information at a glance to help him decide if it is a question
he/she is qualified to attempt or is it a question that has been attempted.

* *Highlights:* This was easy to implement because it only requires a slight redesign. This redesign was also necessary
because the old Contact Card used in AddressBook was insufficient in reflecting certain details of a question while also
having irrelevant fields.

*Minor enhancement*: Redesigned Dashboard (home) page to fit the theme of DukeAcademy more.

*Minor enhancement*: Ensured that all UI components scale properly and appropriately with window size.

*Minor enhancement*: Configured the dimensions of the application window to prevent users from minimizing the window too
much such that the inner components become unusable.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=ning-sy210&tabRepo=AY1920S1-CS2103T-F14-1%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[RepoSense Report]]
