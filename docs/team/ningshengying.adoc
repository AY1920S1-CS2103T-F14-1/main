== PROJECT: Duke Academy

=== About the Project
My team of 4 Computer Science students were tasked with enhancing a basic Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop addressbook
application for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph it into a coding practice application called Duke Academy.

Duke Academy is written in the Java programming language and the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the application is
created with JavaFX. It relies primarily on Command Line Interface (CLI) as its primary input for user commands.

Duke Academy is designed for both coding students and educators alike. It is equipped with a library of programming
questions related to the field of Data Structures and Algorithms for students to practice their coding skills and allows
educators to set their own problem statements for their students to attempt. This enhanced application also allows
students to run their programs within the app itself, track their programming practice history and make personalized notes
all in one application, without the need for external tools.

This is how our project looks like:

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a brief overview of my contributions to the project. A summary of my coding, documentation and other
relevant details will be listed below.

*Major enhancement added*: I have integrated a built-in text editor with a line counter component.

** *What it does:*
. The built-in text editor allows users to code out their solutions internally within Duke Academy itself.
. It is also fully capable of performing auto-indentations for the user.
. The text-editor also has a line counter component which helps the user to keep track and manage his code for
convenient reference.

** *Justification (Text Editor):* This feature improves the product significantly because users do not need to source for an external
text editor to code out their solutions for problems and can instead do everything within Duke Academy itself. This then
increases the productivity of users as they would not need to constantly switch between the external editor and Duke
Academy while attempting questions, providing a hassle-free coding experience.

** *Justification (Auto-Indentation):* This quality-of-life feature significantly increases the user coding experience
in Duke Academy because it helps users organize and compartmentalize their code automatically. Having auto-indentation
means that users do not need to key in 4 spaces manually after every code block, and thus it helps the user uphold
code readability without the user having to do anything on their part.

** *Justification (Line Counter):* This feature adds significant value to the product because it allows users to keep track
of the micro-details in their code. For example, should anything go wrong with their code (e.g. compilation error), they
can quickly trace down the source of the bug and make the necessary changes efficiently and conveniently without having
to trace through line-by-line.

** *Highlights:* This feature is designed to imitate, as closely as possible, the functions of an Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) editor. The implementation of this feature was exceptionally challenging as there were no exact tutorials
on how to design a text editor with the above mentioned features specifically, and thus it was only made possible by putting
together all the small parts.

*Minor enhancement*: Added a UI format for QuestionCard.

* *What it does:* Displays a summary of the question with a clean look that fits the theme of DukeAcademy. It is redesigned
to reflect the topics of the selected question, and the attributes such as whether it is attempted by the user and its
difficulty level.

* *Justification:* This provides the user with adequate information at a glance to help him decide if it is a question
he/she is qualified to attempt or is it a question that has been attempted.

* *Highlights:* This was easy to implement because it only requires a slight redesign. This redesign was also necessary
because the old Contact Card used in AddressBook was insufficient in reflecting certain details of a question while also
having irrelevant fields.

*Minor enhancement*: Redesigned Dashboard (home) page to fit the theme of DukeAcademy more.

*Minor enhancement*: Ensured that all UI components scale properly and appropriately with window size.

*Minor enhancement*: Configured the dimensions of the application window to prevent users from minimizing the window too
much such that the inner components become unusable.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=ning-sy210&tabRepo=AY1920S1-CS2103T-F14-1%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[RepoSense Report]]

== Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|We had to update the original AddressBook User Guide with instructions for the enhancements that
we had added. The following is an excerpt from our Duke Academy User Guide, showing additions that I have
made.
|===

=== Questions
The *Questions* tab contains a list of all the available questions and also a window to view your problem statements.

You can use commands such as `browse` and `find` to filter through the list of questions in order to find what you
are looking for. `browse` can lookup any keywords in titles, difficulty, description, topics, etc. `find` only finds by titles. _(View <<Features>> for more details.)_

. To quickly see all questions, enter `showall` into the *Command Box*.
. To view the problem statement for a question, enter `view <Qn Index>`. The problem statement will then be displayed
on the right.

=== Workspace
The workspace is where you will work on the various questions.

image::workspace.png[width="1000"]

. *Problem Statement Display*
+
Displays the question that you are currently attempting.

. *Program Evaluation Panel*
+
This panel displays the correctness of your program when evaluated against the pre-defined list of test cases tied to the question you are solving.
. *Editor*
+
A built-in editor for you to write your code.

To submit your attempt, enter `submit` into the *Command Box*.

To begin your attempt on a question, enter `attempt <Qn Index>` into the *Command Box*.

To submit your attempt, enter `submit` into the *Command Box*.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Commands are entered into the *CommandBox*
* Words within square braces `[]` are the parameters to be supplied by you, the user.
+
e.g. in `attempt[id]`,
`id` is a parameter which can be used as `attempt 1`.

* Parameters are *compulsory*.
* Parameters with `…`​ after them can accept multiple entries.
+
e.g. `browse [category]...` can be used as
`browse easy linkedlist hashtable recursion` (i.e. 4 entries), etc.
====

=== Find question by title : `find`

Searches for question of which the title contains *strictly* the keywords entered.

*Format:* `find [keyword]...`

****
* *NOTE*: This function does not work for character sequences!
+
e.g. Searching for `su` will *NOT* yield questions with titles such as `Sudoku` or `The Supreme Seven`
* The search is case insensitive.
+
e.g `recursion` will match `Recursion`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter.
+
e.g. `Fun tree` will match `tree Fun`.
* Questions with title matching at least one keyword will be displayed
+
e.g. searching for `sudoku adder` will yield questions with titles such as `Valid Sudoku` and `Two Number Adder`.
****


*Examples:*

* `find binary search tree` +
Finds and displays all questions containing the substrings "binary",  "search" and "tree" in their title.
* `find fizz buzz` +
Finds and displays all the questions containing the substrings "fizz" and "buzz" in its title, but not questions with
titles such as "fizzbuzz".


=== Browse by keywords: `browse`

Searches through all questions with the specified keyword(s). A question is listed as a search result as long as it
contains one of the keyword(s) in their _title, topics, description, status_ or _difficulty_.

*Format:* `browse [keywords]...`

****
* *NOTE*: This function does *NOT* work for character sequences!
+
e.g. Searching for `su` will not yield questions with titles that do not strictly contain the word "su", such as "super".
* The category is case insensitive.
+
e.g `easy` will match `Easy`.
+
* Typing `browse topic` would not list all topics. You can only browse by specific topics. The complete list of topics include: `ARRAY`, `LINKED_LIST`, `HASHTABLE`, `TREE`, `GRAPH`, `RECURSION`,
`DIVIDE_AND_CONQUER`, `DYNAMIC_PROGRAMMING`, `SORTING`, `OTHERS`.
****

*Examples:*

* `browse hashtable linkedlist` +
Finds and displays all questions that contain "hashtable" and "linkedlist".
* `browse number` +
Finds and displays questions that contain strictly the keyword "number".
+
Questions that do not and instead contain words
with "number" as a substring of a word in their _title, topics, description, status_ or _difficulty_ will not be displayed.


=== Viewing the problem statement : `view`

Displays the problem statement of the question.

*Format:* `view [id]`

****
* Displays the problem statement with the corresponding id.
* The id of the question can be seen next to its title.
****

image::view.png[width="1000"]

*Examples:*

* `view 1` +
Displays the question with the id "1" in the right side window of the GUI, as shown in the above picture.

//end::find[]

=== Attempting a question : `attempt`

Navigates to the *Questions* tab where you can code your solution to solve the problem statement.

*Format:* `attempt [id]`

****
* Displays the question with the corresponding id on the upper-left of the GUI.
* The *Editor* will appear on the right side for you to code your solution.
****

image::attempt.png[width=1000"]

=== Submitting your answer: `submit`

Submits your solution.​ Your code will be compiled and run against test cases. The results will be displayed in
the *ProgramEvaluationDisplay* on the bottom left of the GUI.

*Format:* `submit`

****
* Make sure to check that your code compiles or you will receive an error message.
* Remember to import the relevant packages that you have used in your code!
