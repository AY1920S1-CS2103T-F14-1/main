== Project: Duke Academy

Duke Academy is a Java based programming practice application equipped with a wide range of questions related to the field of Data Structures and Algorithms.

== Overview

Duke Academy was built to emulate a Command Line Application where users interact with the GUI by typing commands into a command box.
This decision was made to allow new learners to also familiarize themselves with using a Command Line Interface, an invaluable skill for all programmers.

Duke Academy is an integrated platform with a built-in text editor, an auto-grader and a note-taking feature.

DukeAcademy can also be used as a teaching tool by educators as they can set their own questions to be loaded by their students using our simplified text format.

Duke Academy is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

== My Roles and Contributions

The following segment illustrates the different roles and tasks that I have performed for our team in detail.
It also provides a bit of justification for the different choices that I have made pertaining to these roles and tasks.

=== Change underlying architecture to suit our needs [refactor]

_Due to the increased complexity of our product, a large part of the existing architecture of AddressBook3 had to be changed.
Most of the changes can be summarized into the 3 following sections :_


==== *Separate Logic component*

  * Split the old `Logic` interface in AddressBook3 into separate interfaces, each with their own specialized functions.
  * The new interfaces are `CommandLogic`, `QuestionsLogic`, `ProgramSubmissionLogic` and `NotesLogic`.
  * Each interface facilitates operations pertaining to a different part of our application.
====
Justification :

* Functionality of our application can be split into more cohesive components
* Reduce coupling to make the codebase more  testable and maintainable
====
==== *Implemented Observer pattern* +

  * Created a new simple and lightweight observable class that can be customized using Java generics.

====
Justification :

** Enable UI components to observe and reflect changes in the application state without introducing them as unnecessary dependencies.
** JavaFX's native Observable class was over-engineered for our use case.
====

==== *Refactor Command pattern*

* Change the implementation of the Command pattern to be more flexible.
* `execute()` no longer depends on `Model`.
* Parsing of command arguments is now handled by individual commands.
* Open-closed principle is maintained by registering commands into `CommandLogic` with a `Supplier`.
* `Supplier` is in charge of injecting dependencies into the various commands.

====
Justification :

* New commands no longer depend on `Model` and have their own dependencies.
* New commands require their own unique argument parsing logic.
====

=== Program evaluation feature [feature]

* *What it does* : +
  Allows users' solutions to be automatically evaluated by our application. The solution is evaluated against test cases specified in the `Question` class.

* *Justification* : +
  It is difficult to come up with your own test cases to evaluate your solutions whenever you attempt programming questions. It is also very cumbersome to run each test case manually. Allowing users to automatically have their solutions evaluated will allow them to focus more on their learning.

* *Highlights* :
** Compile and runtime errors are also displayed to the user in the event that they occur so that user's are able to learn from their mistakes.
** A _Time Limit Exceeded_ error is displayed if the user's program takes too long to complete. This will enable users to know if their solutions are properly optimized.

=== Note-taking feature [feature]
* What it does : +
  Allows users to record notes in the form of text or a simple sketch.

* Justification : +
  Being able to pen down ideas is extremely useful when coming up with solutions to programming questions. Furthermore, being able to take notes for future reference will help to reinforce the user's learning.

* Highlights : +
  In addition to taking notes in the form of text, user's are also able to sketch their ideas within a a sketch pad and have them saved for future reference. This is particularly useful when dealing with data structures.

=== Tabs [feature]
* What it does  : +
  Splits the various functions of the application, _browsing and viewing of questions_, _attempting of questions and evaluation of results_, _note-taking_, into individual tabs.

* Justification : +
  Separating the various functions of our application into their own separate tabs will reduce clutter and enable users to be more organized in their learning.

* Highlights : +
  In line with the _Command Line_ theme, the user is able to switch tabs by typing the command _"tab"_ instead of using a mouse-click.
