== Project: Duke Academy
Duke Academy is a Java based programming practice application equipped with a wide range of questions related to the field of Data Structures and Algorithms.


== Overview

Duke Academy was built to emulate a Command Line Application where users interact with the GUI by typing commands into a command box. This decision was made to allow new learners to also familiarize themselves with
using a Command Line Interface, an invaluable skill for all programmers.

Duke Academy is an integrated platform with a built-in text editor, an auto-grader and a note-taking feature. It provides all the tools needed for a good practice session so that its users will never have to tab out to another application.

DukeAcademy can also be used as a teaching tool by educators as they can set their own questions to be loaded by their students using our very own simplified text file format.

Duke Academy is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
