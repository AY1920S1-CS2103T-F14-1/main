[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/difficulty/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/difficulty/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of six components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Includes 3 types of executors: the Command Executor, the Program Submission Executor, and the Question Builder Executor,.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* <<Design-Observable, *`Observable`*>>:
* <<Design-TextExecutor, *`TextExecutor`*>>: Compile the user program and run it against test cases. Output result.

Each of the six components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `QuestionLogic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `QuestionLogic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `QuestionLogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `view 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/difficulty/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/difficulty/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.


[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic components

==== Overview
There are 4 main logic components found in the architecture of Duke Academy. They are `CommandLogic`, `QuestionsLogic`, `ProgramSubmissionLogic` and `NotesLogic`.
Each logic component serves as a *facade* for the basic operations by the application with regards to *Commands*, *Questions*, *ProgramSubmission* and *Notes*.

They orchestrate the execution of these operations internally and expose a simple interface for other components, such as the `UI` to utilize.

The logic components are interfaces so their implementation can be changed easily.

[[fig-ProgramSubmissionLogicClassDiagram]]
.Class diagram of the ProgramSubmissionLogic interface
image::ProgramSubmissionLogicClassDiagram.png[]

[[fig-NotesLogicClassDiagram]]
.Class diagram of the NotesLogic interface
image::NotesLogicClassDiagram.png[]

==== CommandLogic implementation
The standard implementation of the CommandLogic is the `CommandLogicManager` class.
This implementation works by requiring its users to register a `CommandSupplier` functional interface with a specific key.
The command can also be registered with a `CommandFactory` which encapsulates the Key-CommandSupplier relation.

Subsequent calls to the `executeCommand()` method will attempt to match the command String to all the registered keys to
retrieve the correct `CommandSupplier`.

Storage of these keys and the parsing of the `commandText` argument is performed by `CommandParser`.

[[fig-CommandLogicManagerAssociations]]
.Associations of the CommandLogicManager
image::CommandLogicManager.png[]

====
* The `CommandSupplier` only accepts the arguments of the command.
* `InvalidCommandArgumentException` is thrown if the arguments do not match the specification of the command.
* The `CommandParser` splits the command String into the registered key and arguments in order to retrieve the corresponding command.
====

The basic sequence of command execution is as follows:

. `Command` is registered upon startup by the application driver

. The command and its matching key is stored in the `CommandParser` by the `CommandLogicManager`

. User enters command text

. Application driver passes the command text as a String to the `CommandLogicManager`

. `CommandLogicManager` passes on the command text to the `CommandParser` for parsing and `Command` retrieval

. `CommandLogicManager` executes the retrieved `Command`


[[fig-CommandLogicSequenceDiagram]]
.Sequence diagram for command execution
image::CommandLogicSequence.png[]


==== QuestionsLogic implementation
The standard implementation of the `QuestionsLogic` interface is the `QuestionsLogicManager`. This implementation stores the questions
in the application in the form of a `QuestionBank`. It saves any changes made to the `QuestionBank` immediately using a `QuestionBankStorage`.
_(View <<Design-Storage>> for more details.)_

[[fig-QuestionsLogicManagerAssociations]]
.Associations of the QuestionLogicManager
image::QuestionsLogicManager.png[]

====
* The `QuestionsLogicManager` constructor takes in a `QuestionBankStorage` instance which is used to load the initial `QuestionBank` and to save subsequent revisions to it.
* The main bulk of the CRUD operations are handled by the `QuestionBank` class. the `QuestionLogicManager` orchestrate the invocation of the `QuestionBank` methods along with storage of the changes.
====


==== ProgramSubmissionLogic implementation

==== NotesLogic implementation




[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/difficulty/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Duke Academy data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Question>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Duke Academy`, which `Question` can reference. This would allow `Duke Academy` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Question` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

//tag::storage[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :

For Questions, link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/com/dukeacademy/storage/question/QuestionBankStorage.java[`QuestionBankStorage.java`]

For Profile, link: {repoURL}/src/main/java/com/dukeacademy/storage/profile/ProfileStorage.java[`ProfileStorage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Duke Academy question bank in json format and read it back.
* can save the user information in json format and read it back.

//end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `com.dukeacademy.commons` package.

**Core**:

**Exceptions**:

`DataConversionException`: occurs when loading files with incorrect data format.

`IllegalValueException`: occurs when user inputs a invalid command.

**Util**:

`FileUtil`: for loading and saving of files.
`JsonUtil`: for serializing and deserializing json files.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Evaluation of user program submissions
The evaluation of the user's programs is facilitated by the `solutions` package.

==== Entry point

It contains the class `TestExecutor`
which contains a single method `runTestCases(testCases, program)`. This method is used to run a user's program against
a series of test cases.

The method utilizes the classes `TestCase` and `UserProgram` to model the data needed for evaluation.

====
*TestCase* - stores an input and an expected value

image:TestCaseClassDiagram.png[width=240]

*UserProgram* - stores the main class name and the program's source code a String (note that the specified class name
must match the source code for it to be successfully evaluated)

image:UserProgramClassDiagram.png[width=240]

====

The result of the evaluation is returned as a `TestResult` object.

====
*TestResult* - encapsulates all the possible outcomes of evaluating the user's program. It is composed of other model
classes -- `TestCaseResult`, `CompileError`.

image::TestResultDiagram.png[align=center]

====

==== Implementation overview

The evaluation of a user's program is done in 3 main steps, each handled by a specialized interface. The 3 steps include:

====
1. Create a Java file inside a temporary directory in the user's file system and writing the user's program to it.

2. Compile that Java file into an executable Java Class file. Catch and store compile errors if any.

3. Execute the main Class file and provide the inputs of the specified test cases. Collect and store any output from the program.

4. Encapsulate the output, errors and results in a model class
====

This is done by `TestExecutor` with the help of three interfaces that are made available through dependency injection --
`CompilerEnvironment`, `Compiler`, `ProgramExecutor`.

Each interface has its specialized role in the evaluation process.
`TestExecutor` acts as an orchestrator to tie all their functionalities together.

====
*CompilerEnvironment* - in charge of creating a temporary folder in the user's file system to create and write Java files.
This temporary folder is deleted after `closed()`. Utilizes the model class `JavaFile`.

image::CompilerEnvironment.png[align=center]

*Compiler* - in charge of compiling the Java files into Class files at a given file path. Utilizes the model class `ClassFile`.

image::Compiler.png[align=center]

*ProgramExecutor* - in charge of executing the compiled Class files. Utilizes the model class `ProgramOutput`.

image::ProgramExecutor.png[align=center]

*Models:*

* *JavaFile* - contains the canonical name and class path of a Java file with various convenience methods. Note that the file must actually exist or
an `FileNotFoundException` is thrown during instantiation.
* *ClassFile* - contains the canonical name and class path of a Java file with various convenience methods. Note that the file must actually exist or
an `FileNotFoundException` is thrown during instantiation.
* *ProgramInput* - contains the String input to be fed into the user's program.
* *ProgramOutput* - contains the String output produced by the user's program. It also contains convenience methods for producing different outputs.
====

====
*Sequence diagram:*

1. `TestExecutor` calls `clearEnvironment()` of `CompilerEnvironment` to remove any redundant files from previous program
evaluations.

2. `TestExecutor` calls `createJavaFile()` of `CompilerEnvironment` to create the Java file with the class name and source code specified
in the `UserProgram` argument.

3. `TestExecutor` calls `compileJavaFile()` of `Compiler` to compile the newly created Java file.

4. For each test case passed in the argument, `TestExecutor` calls `executeProgram` of `StandardProgramExecutor` with the input from the
test case.

5. `TestExecutor` maps each `ProgramOutput` received into a `TestCaseResult` model instance.

6. `TestExecutor` packs all the data collected from the execution of the test cases into a single `TestResult` instance.

image::TestExecutorSequenceDiagram.png[align:center]
====

==== Implementation details
The implementations of `CompilerEnvironment`, `Compiler` and `ProgramExecutor` used in the application are as follows:

* *StandardCompilerEnvironment* - this implementation utilizes Java11's native Files library to handle creation, deletion and writing of files.

    - Creates a temporary folder when instantiated at the file path injected through its constructor.

    - All files are created in this temporary folder.

    - The temporary folder is deleted in the `close()` method.

    - When tasked to create a new file, it first creates an empty file in the temporary folder before writing the contents of the user's program to the file

* *StandardCompiler* - this implementation utilizes Java11's native JavaCompiler library to programmatically compile Java files.

    - Compile errors recorded by the `DiagnosticsListener` class from the compilation task is parsed and rethrown as `CompilerException` and `CompileContentException`.
    - `CompilerException` represents compile errors caused by the JavaCompiler library while `CompileContentException` represents errors caused by the user's program.

* *StandardProgramExecutor* - this implementation utilizes Java11's native Runtime class to execute programs programatically.

    - To execute a program, `exec(String command)` of the Runtime instance is called.
    - A command to compile the specified `ClassFile` is generated using its class path and canonical name attributes.
    - The method returns a `Process` instance that executes the program on a separate thread.
    - `StandardProgramExecutor` accesses the input stream of the process and feeds the program the necessary inputs.
    - `StandardProgramExecutor` access the output and error stream of the process and collects any produced output or errors.
    - The process is destroyed and the collected output and errors and packaged as a `ProgramOutput` instance.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Home Page

The home page of Duke Academy is the main page that the user sees upon app initialization. Not only does it provide an
introduction and greeting to the user, it also functions as a personal dashboard.

As a personal dashboard, it presents the user with essential information about his personal progress and learning
journey.

Here are three main pieces of information presented to the user:
1. Number of questions completed`
2. Questions that user is still working on
3. Questions that user chose to bookmark for personal reference

To obtain these three pieces of information, we first obtain the `ObservableList` that represents all questions in the
storage. We can obtain this `ObservableList`, from `QuestionLogic`, through a method named `getFilteredQuestionsList()`.

The controller class for Home Page, `HomePage.java` has a constructor that takes in this `ObservableList`. Through
helper methods within the controller class, we can do some processing to the `ObservableList` and easily generate the
three pieces of data.

These pieces of information will then be displayed on the Home Page through standard JavaFX controls.

=== Code Result Panel

The code result panel is a panel below the editor that shows the evaluation of the user's program against the specified
test cases in the question.

It takes in a `List` of `TestCaseResults` which contains useful information about how the user's program fared against
the various test cases.

These information are then displayed on the Code Result Panel through standard JavaFX controls.
