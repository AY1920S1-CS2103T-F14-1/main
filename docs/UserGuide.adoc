== Introduction

Duke Academy is a coding practice platform that operates entirely on your local machine without the need for an internet
connection. Whether you are revising for a test, practicing for a tech interview, or just coding for the sheer joy of
it, DukeAcademy gives you access to a wide range of programming problems from various categories. Easily find something
that suits your needs and interests and start honing your skills today!

Duke Academy features a built-in list of problem sets and its very own text editor. Simply choose a problem statement
that catches your eye, load it up in the problem display panel and start coding away! Duke Academy also features your
very own profile page for you to immediately view all of your accomplishments at a glance. Your profile page also helps
you keep track of the problems that you have attempted and those you have bookmarked, so that you can get back to them
easily at a later time.

For educators, you can use Duke Academy as a platform to administer your assignments or practice questions. If you have
questions of your own you would like to test your students, you can use the built-in question loader in DukeAcademy to
set your own questions and then distribute the updated _questionBank.json_ file to your students through your favourite
communication channels.

Duke Academy is optimized for those who prefer to work with a CLI (Command Line Interface) while still enjoying the
benefits of a GUI (Graphical User Interface). If you are unfamiliar with using a CLI (which is an important skill for all
programmers), you can get used to it while working on your coding skills here in DukeAcademy!

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have link:{Java11URL}[Java 11] or above installed in your Computer.
- Refer to the following links for the complete walk-through (link:{JDKInstallationMac}[macOS] / link:{JDKInstallationWin}[windows])

. Download the latest DukeAcademy.jar link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
. Double-click the .jar file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. If the app cannot be launched by double-clicking:
- Launch Notepad (or any text editor), then copy and paste the following line into the text editor.

 java -jar [name_of_file].jar

- Replace "[name_of_file]" with whatever name you have saved the .jar file as.
- Save the text file as a .bat file in the same location as the .jar file.
- Then double-click on the newly created .bat file to run the app.

. When launching the app for the first time, it will create a folder named _DukeAcademy_ in the directory where your jar is located.
- This folder will contain all of your app's data. To fix any errors related to corrupted data, delete this folder and the app will be reinstalled.

+

+

. Once the app is launched, you will immediately be greeted with the main User Interface of the app.

+
image::homepage_annotated.png[width="1000"]
+
The User Interfaces that are important for now:

1. *Command Box*
+
This will be the field where you input all your commands. After you press the kbd:[Enter] button, your command will be executed.
+
e.g. typing *`showall`*, followed by pressing kbd:[Enter] will display all the questions in the app.
+
To find out about the commands available in Duke Academy, please visit <<Features>>.

2. *Result Box*
+
Once you have executed a command, a feedback will be displayed in this field.
+
e.g. after executing *`showall`* command, "List all questions..." will be displayed.

3. *Tab Panes*
+
Consists of 5 different tabs: _Home_, _Questions_, _Workspace_, _Notes_ and _Help_

. After executing *`showall`* in the *CommandBox*, find a question that interests you and type `attempt <Qn Index>`
  into the *CommandBox* to start your DukeAcademy experience.
+
_Note: the index of a question is the number displayed next to its title._

+

[[Overview]]
== Overview

The application is divided into 5 separate tabs, each one of them serving a specific purpose. You can toggle between the
different tabs by entering `tab` into the *CommandBox*.

=== Home
The *Home* tab contains an introduction of the application, and more importantly, a *Personal Dashboard* for you to keep track of your progress made in Duke Academy.

image::homepage.png[width="1000"]

On the *Personal Dashboard* you can:

. See the percentage of questions you completed and your current skill tier.
+
Novice 0 - 29 % {nbsp} +
Apprentice 30 - 49 % {nbsp} +
Master 50 - 69 % {nbsp} +
Grandmaster 70 - 89 % {nbsp} +
Duke 90 - 100 %
+
. Keep track of the questions that you are currently attempting.
. Keep track of the questions that you bookmarked.

=== Questions
The *Questions* tab contains a list of all the available questions and also a window to view your problem statements.

You can use commands such as `browse` and `find` to filter through the list of questions in order to find what you
are looking for. `browse` can lookup any keywords in titles, difficulty, description, topics, etc. `find` only finds by titles. _(View <<Features>> for more details.)_

. To quickly see all questions, enter `showall` into the *CommandBox*.
. To view the problem statement for a question, enter `view <Qn Index>`. The problem statement will then be displayed
  on the right.

+

+


=== Workspace
The workspace is where you will work on the various questions.

image::workspace.png[width="1000"]

. *Problem Statement Display*
+
Displays the question that you are currently attempting.

. *Program Evaluation Panel*
+
This panel displays the correctness of your program when evaluated against the pre-defined list of test cases tied to the question you are solving.
. *Editor*
+
A built-in editor for you to write your code.

To submit your attempt, enter `submit` into the *CommandBox*.

To begin your attempt on a question, enter `attempt <Qn Index>` into the *CommandBox*.

To submit your attempt, enter `submit` into the *CommandBox*.

=== Notes
The notes page is where you can record notes or even sketch out some of your ideas to aid your learning process.

image::notespage.png[width="1000"]

. NotesListDisplay
+
Displays all of the notes that you have previously created.
+

. CurrentNoteTitle
+
Shows the title of the note that you are currently viewing/editing.
+

. NoteTextInput
+
Input space for any text-based notes that you wish to record.
+

. Sketchpad
+
A canvas for you to draw any ideas you may have pertaining to data structures!
+


To create a new note, enter `newnote <Title>` into the *CommandBox*

To open an exiting note, enter `opennote <Id> into the *CommandBox*.

The id of the note is the number that appears next to the title in the *NotesListDisplay*.

To save any changes to your notes, enter `savenote` into the *CommandBox*.

=== Help
The help page is where you can get a quick summary of all of the features and commands in the application.

[[BeforeStart]]
== Before you start

. The program evaluator uses *stdin* to feed your program inputs and *stdout* to receive your program's outputs. Thus,
it is important that your program uses the `Scanner` class to read inputs and for you to print your results.

. Take note that your program is being evaluated *on your local machine* and not within a container or a virtual machine.
Thus, *do not write any code that you would not want to run on your local machine*.
