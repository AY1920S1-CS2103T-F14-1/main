== Introduction

DukeAcademy is a coding practice platform that operates entirely on your local machine without the need for an internet
connection. Whether you are revising for a test, practicing for a tech interview, or just coding for the sheer joy of
it, DukeAcademy gives you access to a wide range of programming problems from various categories. Easily find something
that suits your needs and interests and start honing your skills today!

DukeAcademy features a built-in list of problem sets and its very own text editor. Simply choose a problem statement
that catches your eye, load it up in the problem display panel and start coding away! DukeAcademy also features your
very own profile page for you to immediately view all of your accomplishments at a glance. Your profile page also helps
you keep track of the problems that you have attempted and those you have bookmarked, so that you can get back to them
easily at a later time.

For educators, you can use DukeAcademy as a platform to administer your assignments or practice questions. If you have
questions of your own you would like to test your students, you can use the built-in question loader in DukeAcademy to
set your own questions and then distribute the updated _questionBank.json_ file to your students through your favourite
communication channels.

DukeAcademy is optimized for those who prefer to work with a CLI (Command Line Interface) while still enjoying the
benefits of a GUI (Graphical User Interface). If you are unfamiliar with using a CLI (which is an important skill for all
programmers), you can get used to it while working on your coding skills here in DukeAcademy!

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have link:{Java11URL}[Java 11] or above installed in your Computer.
- Refer to the following links for the complete walk-through (link:{JDKInstallationMac}[macOS] / link:{JDKInstallationWin}[windows])

. Download the latest DukeAcademy.jar link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
. Double-click the .jar file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. If the app cannot be launched by double-clicking:
- Launch Notepad (or any text editor), then copy and paste the following line into the text editor.

 java -jar [name_of_file].jar

- Replace "[name_of_file]" with whatever name you have saved the .jar file as.
- Save the text file as a .bat file in the same location as the .jar file.
- Then double-click on the newly created .bat file to run the app.

. When launching the app for the first time, it will create a folder in your User home directory.
- This folder will contain all of your app's data. To fix any errors related to corrupted data, delete this folder and the app will be reinstalled.

This will be the field where you input all your commands. After you press the kbd:[Enter] button, your command will be executed.
+
e.g. typing *`showall`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will display all the questions in the app.

2. *ResultDisplayBox*
+
Once you have executed a command, a feedback will be displayed in this field.
+
e.g. after executing *`showall`* command, "List all questions..." will be displayed.

3. *TabView*
+
Consists of 3 different tabs: _Home_, _Questions_ and _Workspace_

. After executing *`showall`* in the *CommandBox*, find a question that interests you and type `attempt <Qn Index>`
  into the *CommandBox* to start your DukeAcademy experience.
+
_Note: the index of a question is the number displayed next to its title._
